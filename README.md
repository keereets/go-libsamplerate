# libsamplerate in pure Go

This is the porting of the C library [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) to pure Go.

I needed to do some conversion of audio files, and I wanted to do that in Go.

The library seems to be working very well, I have added many tests, and I am actively using it.
I still have some cleanups to do, but the core functionality of the original C libsamperate 0.2.2 is all there working!
